SSm TOOLBOX INSTALLATION NOTES
******************************

-- SSmGO Toolbox R2010A --

Requirements:

- Matlab 6.5 or higher (tested with 6.5 to 7.8 under Windows)
- Matlab Optimization Toolbox (for using some of the local solvers, like e.g., fmincon or fminsearch)

Note: the current full version is for Windows only. Some features may not work under linux.

Installation:
1- Unzip the .zip (or .rar) archive in your PC (do not change the dir structure)
2- Start a Matlab session
3- Type "which ssm_kernel". If you get a non-empty string, you may need to remove an older version of the SSmGO Toolbox from the Matlab path
5- Go to the root folder in which you unzipped the toolbox
5- Type "ssm_startup"
6- Start using SSmGO Toolbox (see tutorial to know how to implement optimization problems)
