% it_results = iteration_noSS_noCC(fixed_values,kfixed)
% Does an iteration of the procedure, but skips the parameter estimation
% and pre/post regression diagnostics, only deciding which parameters to
% fix according to sensitivity and identifiability.
%
% INPUTS:
% fixed_values      Values from the first iteration
% kfixed            Vector indicating which parameters are fixed
%                   Complete the rest of the parameters with NaN
%
% OUTPUT:
% it_results        Structure containing all iteration results
